Hello,

I'm talking with several recruiters, so apologies for the form letter response.  

I am responding to all e-mail conversations I have had recently or perhaps long ago with recruiters. 

Please find my short form resume attached in Microsoft Word and PDF format.

Here is my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-n-wyble/ which contains much more information. Feel free to send me an invite! Long form resume available upon request.

If you sent me an RTR, this reply is me confirming it. If the position is no longer available, I'm interested in other open positions, please see below for what I'm seeking.

## Highlights:

* Linux/Windows/Networking/Storage experience in both enterprise IT and SRE roles (senior staff level)
* Seeking (on w2) 65.00 an hour /130k per annum (with 70/140k or better strongly preferred as that's the current market rate). For fully remote , 1099, c2c roles, where it's a strong team/role fit, I'm open to discussing a potentially lower salary of ~60 per hour / ~120k.
